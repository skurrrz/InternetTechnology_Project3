# InternetTechnology_Project3
This was the final project for the course "Internet Technology."

This project presentes simulations of three different methods of 
sending packets between two end hosts. These mechanisms are Stop-and-Wait, 
Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat. All of these simulations are
written using Python 3.0 and can be run in the command line. 

To run, open two CLIs, run the Sender.py file and then the Receiver.py file 
for any given method.
